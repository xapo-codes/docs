# Starting Out

This page explains how to start using NodeTunnel in a Godot project.

It shows:
- what NodeTunnel needs to exist
- what the setup looks like
- how connecting, hosting, and joining work!

Code snippets are small and only meant to show what you should expect to see.

---

## NodeTunnel installed

NodeTunnel must already be available in your project.

You should be able to reference the class:
---

var peer := NodeTunnelPeer.new()
If this line errors, NodeTunnel is not installed correctly.

Creating a NodeTunnel peer
NodeTunnel works by providing a custom multiplayer peer.

A peer is created like this:

gdscript
Copy code
var peer := NodeTunnelPeer.new()
This object handles:

relay connections

rooms

peer communication

Assigning the multiplayer peer
NodeTunnel must be assigned to Godot’s multiplayer system.

gdscript
Copy code
multiplayer.multiplayer_peer = peer
Until this is assigned, NodeTunnel will not be used.

Connecting to a relay
To use NodeTunnel, the peer must connect to a relay server.

gdscript
Copy code
peer.connect_to_relay("45.33.64.148:8080", "my_game")
The relay address points to the NodeTunnel relay

The app ID separates your game from others using the same relay

This is usually called once when multiplayer starts.

Authentication
Relay connection is asynchronous.

You must wait for the authenticated signal before hosting or joining rooms.

gdscript
Copy code
peer.authenticated.connect(func():
	print("Relay authenticated")
)
If this signal does not fire, hosting and joining will fail.

Hosting a room
Once authenticated, a room can be hosted.

gdscript
Copy code
peer.host_room(true, "My Lobby", 4)
This:

registers a room with the relay

makes this client the host

allows other clients to join

Joining a room
To join an existing room, use its room ID.

gdscript
Copy code
peer.join_room(room_id)
Room IDs are typically obtained from a room list.

Room connection
Hosting or joining is complete when the room_connected signal fires.

gdscript
Copy code
peer.room_connected.connect(func(room_id):
	print("Connected to room:", room_id)
)
Do not assume hosting or joining succeeded until this signal fires.

Disconnects

---

Always handle forced disconnects.

gdscript
Copy code
peer.forced_disconnect.connect(func():
	print("Disconnected from relay")
)
This signal fires when the relay disconnects the client.
